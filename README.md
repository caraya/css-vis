# css-vis: visualizing css properties

This project uses  [D3 Data Visualization Library](http://d3js.org/) to illustrate available CSS properties as  documented in the [Web Platform Documentation Project](http://docs.webplatform.org/).

You can see the resulting visualization on my [labs page](http://labs.rivendellweb.net/css-vis/css-tree3.html)

## Running the examples

Once you have donwnloaded the examples you can move them to a local web server such as MAMP or XAMP. 

If you have pythoon installed you can run the built in web server. If you're using Python 2 run the following command

```python
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

If you're using Python 3, use:

```python
python -m http.server 8000
```
